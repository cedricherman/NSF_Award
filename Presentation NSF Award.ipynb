    "The idea is to come up with a classification model that can tell you the award type based on the abstract. To do so, we have hundred of thousands of abstracts across many fields at our disposal. A Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm following N-grams word vectorization was selected. After optimization, accuracy rate is ~77%.\n",
